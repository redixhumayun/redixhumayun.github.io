## What's In An OS?

Abstractions rule the world around us and they are growing more numerous by the day. This is a good thing.

However, the pace of the technology industry outstrips everything else around it. Since the 1970's, tech has built layers upon layers of abstraction on top of everything. So much so that, I don't know if people today can even comprehend everything that is going on in a computer.

People make the same argument about an automobile but I think it is far easier to understand the inner workings of a car than a computer. At least until electric cars are dominant?

Take AWS for instance, they abstracted servers away. Now, everything is a service. Everything is about building the application now. You don't need to worry about the underlying hardware at all. With AWS CDK, setting up infrastructure is literally just an API call.

This, in turn, is a massive productivity booster for the entire world. We can turn more of our attention into building services that differentiate in ways that matter more to customers. Video streaming services like Netflix, Disney+ etc. wage wars over content with the eventual winner being the consumer.

Building an abstraction like an OS frees up time for people to worry about what really matters: the customer experience.

## Why Do We Need A Manufacturing OS?

Manufacturing, as does every other industry, lags behind the tech industry. However, manufacturing industries are notorious for being slow to move & innovate. There are good reasons for this.

The number one reason is the sheer size and scale of the industry. Manufacturing is a volume optimization problem. Economies of scale ensure that when you are producing massive quantities of the same good, the marginal cost of each good reduces. The eventual winner of this? The consumer.

However, scale comes with massive drawbacks. It's a hard industry to enter because the capital requirements are so massive. The sheer size promotes slow movement and innovation. You don't want to "move fast & break things" here, because there's a lot more at stake than having a broken button on a website.

Not only is manufacturing a hard industry to enter, it's also a notoriously hard industry to deal with. Access to manufacturing is not democratized at all. It's always been in the hands of a few big players because of economies of scale. The big players are the only ones who can guarantee orders of a certain volume and that's what scale requires to operate efficiently.

Consequently, this means that everybody who doesn't have orders in the range of millions of units cannot get access to these manufacturers and cannot get access to cheap manufacturing. In the world of micro-entrepreneurship driven by Shopify, this is a serious problem.

But, that's where a manufacturing operating system comes in.

## What's In A Manufacturing OS?

API calls, API calls all the way down. That's what manufacturing should be.

Dealing with scale is a hard, hard problem. The only way to make that problem easier is to split up the work into smaller, manageable chunks and delegate. Which is precisely what an API does.

Manufacturing is driven by optimization and efficiency. Two things computers excel at. Two things humans are inherently bad at.

The point of a manufacturing OS is to take all the complexity and put it behind an abstraction. Identical to what AWS did with servers.

Dealing with a physical server breaking is an absolute nightmare. You have very little idea what's going wrong, you resort to trying to re-install the OS and firmware and pray it works. Failing that, you try to understand the actual cause of hardware failure (which is virtually impossible given the complexity I mentioned earlier). Finally, you end up either replacing the server entirely or calling in an expert who can help you.

AWS gathered experts in one place, gathered hardware in one place and offered a service of setting up servers with an API call.

Why should manufacturing be any different? The different with manufacturing is that dealing with manufacturers is the real complexity. You have to deal with cultural boundaries, geographical boundaries and language barriers all while putting up a massive amount of capital that you hope doesn't go to waste.

We need an abstraction layer between people who want manufacturing done and the actual manufacturers.

## What It Can Bring

Democratization of manufacturing. That's what it brings.

AWS brought democratization of infrastructure, Shopify brought democratization of internet storefronts. We need democratization of manufacturing.

The world has been too obsessed in building purely digital goods. We still live in a physical world and until Zuck's carnival with Oculus comes to anything, that still remains the case.

A physical world requires physical goods. Physical goods require manufacturing.

Every Shopify merchant selling t-shirts with logos on them, every influencer selling merchandise with their face emblazoned on it needs this. They just don't know it yet.

In business, there is the concept of a value add. A value add is typically the one thing a business does that adds actual value. It's usually just one thing. For instance, the value add AWS offers is their API to set up physical infrastructure. Everything else that they do like maintenance, troubleshooting, customer support etc. is an add-on. It's not their core business.

Similarly, Shopify merchants have one value add: marketing. Shopify abstracted away a lot of the hard problems of setting up a website and selling merchandise on it, Stripe abstracted away a lot of the hard problems about payments on the internet, the next step is to abstract away a lot of the problems around physical goods manufacturing & delivery so that merchants can focus on marketing, which is what gets people to buy their product.
