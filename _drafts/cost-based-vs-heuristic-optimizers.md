## Relevant Dimensions To Compare Optimizer Models

- How do OLTP vs OLAP differ in terms of optimizers? Which do they prefer? Why?
- Runtime cost. What is the tradeoff?
- What is the cost of stale statistics for each? Is there more of a performance hit on CBO? [Perhaps relevant](https://medium.com/nazar-io/sql-performance-killers-stale-statistics-f735411facc8)
- Do SQL vs NoSQL systems differ in how they do optimization?
- What about cloud-native vs traditional databases? What about shared-storage vs shared-nothing databases?


## Systems To Analyze

### OLTP
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL

### OLAP
- DuckDB
- Clickhouse

| Database | Primary Approach | Target Workload |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| ClickHouse | Heuristic â†’ CBO | OLAP |
| DuckDB | Hybrid Rules+Cost | OLAP |
| PostgreSQL | Cost-Based + GEQO | OLTP |
| SQLite | Cost-Based | OLTP |
