# About Me

Hi, my name is Zaid Humayun. I'm a self-taught developer, and am curious about how computers work.
This website is my attempt at documenting my learnings in the field.

I'm primarily interested in learning about databases. I'm currently working at [Conviva](https://conviva.com/) on the streaming engine.

I'm always happy to chat about programming and any related topics around it, so feel free to reach out :) I'm reachable by email (redixhumayun@gmail.com) and good with Twitter DM's!
