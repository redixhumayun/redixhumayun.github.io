# About Me

Hi, my name is Zaid Humayun. I am a self-taught developer, and am very curious about how computers work.
This website is my attempt at documenting my learnings in the field.

I am currently looking out for new opportunities. You can find my resume [here](https://zaid-humayun-resume.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Zaid_Humayun_Resume_2022.pdf).
