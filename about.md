      Hi, my name is Zaid Humayun. I'm a self-taught developer with an insatiable curiosity about how computers work 
      at the deepest levels. This website serves as my digital laboratory‚Äîa place where I document my explorations 
      into the fascinating world of systems programming, databases, and performance optimization.

    <h2>Areas of Focus</h2>
    <div class="expertise-grid">
      <div class="expertise-card">
        <h3>Database Internals</h3>
        <p>Deep dives into storage engines, B-trees, LSM trees, and distributed database architectures. 
        From understanding how data is stored on disk to exploring consensus algorithms like Raft.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="expertise-card">
        <h3>Systems Programming</h3>
        <p>Low-level programming in C and Rust, exploring memory management, concurrency primitives, 
        and performance optimization techniques.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="expertise-card">
        <h3>Concurrency & Performance</h3>
        <p>Understanding parallel computing, async runtimes, cache-conscious data structures, 
        and the intricate details of modern multi-core architectures.</p>

    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently working at <a href="https://conviva.com/" target="_blank">Conviva</a> on the streaming engine, 
      where I help process <strong>5 trillion daily events</strong> through a custom DAG-based analytics platform. 
      This role has given me hands-on experience with large-scale distributed systems and real-world performance optimization challenges.

  <div class="connect-section">
    <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
    <p>
      I'm always excited to discuss programming, databases, systems architecture, or any related technical topics. 
      Whether you're debugging a thorny concurrency issue or exploring the latest database research, I'd love to hear from you.
